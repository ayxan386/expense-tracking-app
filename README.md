 This project brought some interesting challenges for me:
  1. Building REST Api for d3js, I used d3js prior to this project but data was usually provided. Thus, making backend
for that purpose only without overcomplicated logic was engaging, and helped to look at backend from different perspective
  2. This was the my second time using bootstrap with bootswatch which is incredible experience by itself. 
  Using predefined designs and colors contrasting very beautifully can make even small app like this one look a lot more
  professional
  3. While working on this project I realized that I write more complex HTML in JavaScript files rather than in index.html,
  and that is without major Frontend library/framework such React
  
 Overall, it is a great excise to practise many skills.
